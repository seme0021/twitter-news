Twitter News Stream + Touch of ML
=================================


Redis Schema
------------

Incoming tweets -- these are generated by the tw.py script, that just reads through the list of queries, searches twitter,
and stashes these tweets in a redis que.

    #Unprocessed Tweets (upt)
    upt:tweet-id:twitter-handle:timestamp 'name' 'screen_name' 'tweet' 'fav_count' 'rtw_count' 'created_at' 'user_image_url' 'user_follower_count' 


There is also a worker script that reads the unprocced tweets and decides what to do with them. The worker script can decide to
   1. Throw the tweet away completely 
   2. Add-it to Topical Tweets w/out News
   3. Add-it to Topical Tweets w/News
After it's done processing the tweet, it will remove it from the unprocessed que.

    #Classified Events
    datetime-stamp:<classification>:twitter-handle:tweet-id
    #Unclassified Events
    datetime-stamp:unclassified:twitter-handle:tweet-id
    
...will finish documentation later.
